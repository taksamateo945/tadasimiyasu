The stunner took to social media to fill fans in on her travel plans.</p><p class=align-left>Being the total hottie that she is, Mihlali has had men falling at her feet her entire life. Sis, however, was not flattered by the attention and did not settle for a man who didn’t see her for more than just her beauty.</p><p class=align-left><strong>We </strong>learnt that Mihlali and her mystery man are taking a little trip together. Baecations have become a thing and celebs are always levelling up with the lushness.</p><p class=align-left>Mihlali Ndamase is one of South Africa's celebrities who became popular because of her makeup tutorials on YouTube. She has a passion for skin care products, make-up, as well as beauty, and this granted her the opportunity to work with major brands like MAC Cosmetics, Urban Decay, Benefit Cosmetics, Samsung, NYX Professional makeup, and Aldo. As a professional make up artist, Ndamase is presently under MAC training.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8cbb56eb302b9304.png><p class=align-left>Mihlali keeps her romantic life rather personal and has yet to reveal who her man is despite many falling to their knees at the news.</p><p class=align-left>Taking to social media, Mihlali announced her little baecation and showed off her lush new locks she had done for the trip. We hope you have a lush time, babes!</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: AKA drops Boity Thulo in the dirt after heated comment about men</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Sjava gives his side of story amid allegations by Lady Zamar</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>We</strong> previously reported opening her Instagram account and starting her YouTube channel, Mihlali Ndamase did not have the intention of becoming an influencer. Things just happened so quickly, which in turn gave others the impression that it is super easy to do.</p><p class=align-left>Mihlali has come out to set the record straight. The assumption people have that it just takes a photo here and there are living in a dream world. The whole concept is not as easy as it looks.</p><p class=align-left>Mihlali said that people are only looking at the end product and not taking into consideration what happens behind the scenes. She explained that a lot of work goes into it and you need to put in money to get money back. You have to work consistently and most importantly, be authentic, she said.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
