Ariana Madix of ‘Vanderpump Rules’ is tired of the showrunners making her beau look bad.</p><p>During the last episode of the show, Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz show up to an unopened TomTom even though Lisa Vanderpump said in confessionals she told them not to come to the location.</p><p>After watching the show, the Bravolebrity went off on Twitter.</p><p>“The whole “the toms are idiots” schtick is so old and tired. Why can’t it just be real? Way more interesting imo.”</p><p>A fan hit back saying that the friends couldn’t follow LVP’s very simple instructions.</p><p>Madix replied: “I’m saying it’s their job to show up for filming. Literally just said it.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/ariana2525/status/1085039132542349312</a></p><p>The same follower restated what she said before to which Ariana quipped: “They. Got. A. Call time. This is not hard. Do I need to tell you what a call time is.”</p><p>Another attempted voice of reason asked why didn’t the Toms just say that they were told to show up at that specific time. The aspiring comedian then explained in show business terms.</p><p>“Ya… it’s called breaking the fourth wall. Something we aren’t allowed to do. Hence the “oops” gif. We show up when we are given call times by our employers: production. I hope you find some relaxation in your future bc jeez.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/ariana2525/status/1085041309667057665</a></p><p>In the past, Ariana and Stassi Schroeder appeared to be mortal enemies. During the current season, the blondes team up to form Nasstariana and celebrate their birthdays together – much to fans surprise.</p><p>When asked when she and Stassi became close, the lipstick line owner blamed that on production too. Ariana explained that she and Schroeder have been close for a while but editing makes it seem like they still didn’t like each other until recently.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Ariana’s rant? Is editing always to blame?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7aiusBmpJqcma16trrLnpisoJWoerC6jK%2BYp5yVp722uc9mqa6klah6sb7OnaycnaKoeqe70WakmqOZo7RuwMeeZK2nnah6rbvOpGSdrZ2XenN%2FlWttcWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./porsha-williams-posts-adorable-photos-of-daughter-pilar-jhena-after-her-romance-with-ex-husband-kordell-stewart-is-rehashed-367087.html><span>←</span><span>Porsha Williams Posts Adorable Photos Of Daughter Pilar Jhena After Her Romance With Ex-Husband Kord</span></a>
