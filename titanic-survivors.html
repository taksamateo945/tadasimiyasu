The sinking of the Titanic was a disaster of such massive proportions that it tends to eclipse the tales of two other luxury liners: its sister ships.
When the Titanic was built, it was one of a set of three massive, celebrated passenger ships — all of which encountered disaster on the high seas.
One, the Britannic, suffered an explosion and sank in 1916."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The other, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Olympic</a>, was involved in two devastating collisions but managed to stay afloat.</p><p>And one woman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Violet Jessop</a>, was unlucky enough to have been aboard all three ships as they met with disaster.</p><p>Violet Jessop was an ocean-liner stewardess, and by the time the Titanic struck the iceberg on April 14, 1912, Jessop had already survived one near-fatal accident at sea.</p><p>Less than a year earlier, she had been aboard the RMS Olympic when it collided with the HMS Hawke, a British warship that tore a massive hole in the luxury liner’s side. The watertight compartments the White Star ships were famous for held, and the ship made it to port.</p><p>But the Titanic wasn’t so lucky. As the ship went down, Jessop, now a veteran of calamity, was ordered to the top deck to help non-English speaking passengers. According to her memoirs, she loaded the lifeboats and modeled calm, orderly behavior until she was eventually commanded to board Lifeboat 16.</p><p>As the boat was being lowered into the water, one of the officers gave Jessop a baby to look after. After a long night on the ocean, both she and the baby made it to the rescue ship, where a woman, presumably the baby’s mother, grabbed the child and ran off without saying a word.</p><p>Jessop retired from her maritime career in 1950 with the nickname “Miss Unsinkable.” She died in 1971 at age 83.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1tdOapaKbXajCs8LIr6arq19p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actress-lupita-nyongo-overcomes-fear-and-adopts-her-first-cat.html><span>←</span><span>Actress Lupita Nyongo Overcomes Fear and Adopts Her First Cat</span></a>
