In the clip, the hairdresser is seen sewing the wig cap and the wig onto the woman's - which was the first red flag, as @neoentlekim asked why she was doing so. The hairdresser insists that she knows what she is doing and that @neoentlekim must trust her.</p><p class=align-left>The video goes on to show the unimpressed <a href=#>woman patiently sitting</a> through the disastrous hair experience and with an awful final result, as the installation was a far cry from the stylish hairdo @neoentlekim wanted.</p><p class=align-left>See the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> below:</p><p class=align-left>Owner of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lungstar Salon</a> in <a href=#>Durban</a>, Lungi, who specialises in frontal wig making, selling and installing, told <strong>Briefly News</strong> that there is no need to sew a front wig onto a client's head.</p>"The method used by the hairstylist in the video is unfamiliar to me. When installing a wig, all you need is to make sure the lace of the wig is cut properly, fit it to the client's head and then apply a good quality glue to the hairline and hold it done using a secure band so that the wig glue sets well. Then you would go on to style the hair as desired," Lungi shared.<h2>Mzansi amused by installation fail</h2><p class=align-left>Jokes and banter flew in the post's comments section as netizens reacted to the woman's wig installation gone wrong. Others questioned why she didn't speak up and complain.</p><p class=align-left>‍♂️Tinta said:</p>"Why are they not honest when they cant do something sorry chommy."<p class=align-left>Tshiamo Bontle Ndebe replied:</p>"Permanent hairstyle."<p class=align-left>barbieeeee_nba said:</p>chomi and you continued to sit."<p class=align-left>Nana_MaJili commented:</p>"Nawe wahlala ekwenza udoti ."<p class=align-left>asandaluthuli responded:</p>"Letha iAddress siyomshaya."<p class=align-left>Fiona commented:</p>"Why ungamshayanga??"<p class=align-left>nqobile_120 commented:</p>"Why ungamlumanga ibele ."<h2>Woman shows how wig installations ruined her hairline</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that a young <a href=#>Mzansi</a> woman took to social media to share how lace wig installations have <a href=#>ruined her natural hairline</a> and forehead.</p><p class=align-left>A video shared by Sandisiwe Gaiza on <a href=#>TikTok</a> shows her revealing how damaged her hairline is as well as how some of the skin on her forehead has little sores.</p><p class=align-left>She also showed clips of herself rocking various lace wigs installed using Ghost Bond glue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLGxzqmjnmdhbIJ5fpNmqp6vnmK7qrPHraSaqpVixLC5wKeqZqSRmLJuw8igZKKmo6murbiMr6CrmZxixLO7zaBkq52RqLyvv4ytoKSsn6B6t7XDnqZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-edge-season-3-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Edge Season 3: Cast, Trailer, Review, Watch Online On Amazon Prime</span></a>
