"And I even texted him, you know, right after they signed Russell. I said, 'Now you finally got you a quarterback that has credibility.' A guy who's going to be in the lineup that you can count on being in the lineup week in and week out."</p>Jim Rome <span class=acct>@jimrome</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/P2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@P2&lt;/a> says he wants to re-sign in Pittsburgh and Mike Tomlin is a major reason why. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e3acy3Phco">pic.twitter.com/e3acy3Phco&lt;/a></p><p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Wilson is the stabilizing presence Peterson expects him to be in the Steel City.</p><p>The nine-time Pro Bowler is only signed for one year at the veteran's minimum and Pittsburgh has a replacement waiting in the wings with Justin Fields. You wouldn't expect Tomlin to hesitate in making a change if the offense begins to stagnate over multiple weeks.</p><p>But there's no question even the 2023 version of Wilson is better than what the Steelers were throwing out there. His 26 touchdown passes were double the collective output of Pittsburgh and his 204.7 yards per game were higher than the 186.1 yards that Kenny Pickett, Mitchell Trubisky and Mason Rudolph combined to post.</p><p>Between Wilson and Fields, the Steelers should have the kind of passer they need to be a threat to dethrone the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmd%2FeH%2BMqZitqpmYuG68xK2cq6ufo3q0wMSeo56qo2KzqrrApaOyZZiWw6Z5wGaom2WnnsGpecKrnJ2hkp65qsDYZqCnZaKqwLSxy6VksKGcqLyv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./undercover-cop-in-a-drug-deal-html.html><span>←</span><span>Undercover cop in a drug deal</span></a>
