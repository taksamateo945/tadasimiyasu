I was telling him that he needed to get all over the show. This was it: He was back in the game.’</p><p>He added that ‘Kim tagged him in a couple posts and he just jumped from 100K followers to about 3 million real quick. And then he was like, ‘Can you believe this? Kim and Kanye invited me to the wedding, but they did not give me a plus-one. And I want to bring Kaitlynn!’’</p><p>Apparently, Kimye wanted to keep their ceremony very private and intimate, which is why they did not give Kaitlynn an invitation as well.</p><p>At that point, Brody had been dating her for only a year so it was not that serious.</p><p>Spencer even argued that ‘Brody dates lots of girls for a year.’</p><p>But, according to him, ‘Kaitlynn made such a big deal about it that Brody didn’t go to the wedding and publicly made statements about how they didn’t give him a plus one. Kaitlynn for sure thought if they played hard to get, Kim would give in.’</p><p>As far as he’s concerned, however, nobody is entitled to a wedding invitation, especially not as a ‘plus one.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you agree or not?
