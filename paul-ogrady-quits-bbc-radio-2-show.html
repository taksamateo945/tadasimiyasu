decision to replace popular DJ Steve Wright with Radio 1’s Scott Mills as the corporation seeks to ‘try something different’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>As he exited Wogan House in July, donning a purple shirt, red striped tie and suit jacket, Wright told reporters it was ‘nice of you to come over’, adding: ‘That’s the way it goes… You know, sometimes people want you, sometimes they don’t.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Sometimes they want to make changes, give you another offer, and that’s okay, I understand that, I really understand that.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fans of the DJ, who has been with the corporation for more than 40 years after joining in 1980 to present a Radio 1 Saturday night show, said they will stop listening to the afternoon slot when he leaves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>TONY BLACKBURN</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In June, Tony Blackburn attacked the BBC for its ‘strange’ decision to move his Radio 2 show.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 79-year-old DJ appeared to blame the decision on ageism, saying in a post on social media ‘there’s a lot of it about’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Blackburn learned that from mid-July his Golden Hour show would be moved from 7pm on Fridays to the same time on Sunday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Blackburn criticised the ‘wacky’ decision on Twitter, and fans of the show flocked to support the former Radio 1 DJ. One commented that the BBC was ‘making a lot of mistakes’ by changing up the scheduling.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>CRAIG CHARLES&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Craig Charles’ Radio 2 show on a Saturday night was axed as part of a major shake up of the BBC channel, sparking uproar from fans.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The star, 57, has presented his show Craig Charles’ House Party on Saturdays from 10pm to midnight since 2014.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a series of other changes Drag Race star Michelle Visage will permanently join the station with a Friday slot from 7-9pm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Craig said in the announcement from the BBC: ‘Every party must come to an end and although I’m packing up my Trunk of Funk on Radio 2, I’ve loved bringing the party to its funky listeners each Saturday night.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>VANESSA FELTZ</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Also in July,&nbsp;Vanessa Feltz quit her&nbsp;early morning breakfast show after nearly 20 years on air.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Feltz said she had to step down ‘to

class=mol-para-with-font>Breaking down on her show as she announced the news to her listeners, the star said she would ‘try not to cry’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘I have something to tell you, and I know you already know that I love you – oh I knew I was going to cry but I’m going to try not too… It has been an honour to share the early hours with you.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>ANDREW MARR</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Andrew Marr&nbsp;quit the Corporation last winter to front shows on LBC and Classic FM, and is thought to have significantly increased his pay of up to £339,999 in the move.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Marr’s new weekday show will see him become the newest member of LBC’s line-up, which includes Nick Ferrari, James O’Brien, Eddie Mair, Shelagh Fogarty, Iain Dale, Tom Swarbrick, David Lammy, Camilla Tominey and Matt Frei.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>EMILY MAITLIS and JON SOPEL</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel followed Andrew Marr and jumped ship for LBC in February this year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The veteran journalists caused disarray at Broadcasting House after deciding to join Leicester Square-based Global, which is also home to Nick Ferrari, Eddie Mair, Shelagh Fogarty and James O’Brien.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Maitlis, who hosted Newsnight, has had a series of impartiality complaints against her because of her tweets and on-air comments about the pandemic, the Tory Government and Boris Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>DAN WALKER&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dan Walker also jumped ship and ditched the BBC, joining&nbsp;Channel 5&nbsp;to be lead anchor on its revamped 5News team.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He walked away from his £295,000-295,999 a year role at the Beeb</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The BBC&nbsp;dismissed the ‘brain drain’ of top talent ditching the broadcaster as ‘people come, people go’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Insiders said there was always a ‘natural point where people move on’ but there are mounting fears the Corporation will be left with a lack of experienced presenters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Helen Thomas, Head of Radio 2, added: ‘I’d like to thank Paul for so many years of his brilliant Sunday afternoon show.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m sorry to see him go, but I wish Paul the very best of luck for the future and hope to work with him again as the door is always open to him here at Radio 2.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The star&nbsp;<span style=font-size:16px>launched his weekly Sunday afternoon show in 2009, and for many years Paul ‘The Grinch’ O’Grady has hosted his Christmas Day special on the network featuring messages and dedications from listeners all over the world, as well as an eclectic seasonal playlist.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>In February, after the schedule change prompted an unhappy response from listeners, the BBC said plans ‘evolve over time’.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>O’Grady, also known by his drag queen persona Lily Savage, had told his Instagram followers: ‘There’s a new regime now… which is nothing to do with me as it’s a management decision.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His final show will feature his regular features, including Lost TV Theme, the Thank You Letter Of The Week and an unexpected playlist.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The BBC confirmed Beckett will return for at least another 13 weeks of shows from Sunday August 21.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>It comes after Radio 2 fans deplored the BBC’s decision to replace popular DJ Steve Wright with Radio 1’s Scott Mills as the corporation seeks to ‘try something different’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>As he exited Wogan House in July, donning a purple shirt, red striped tie and suit jacket, Wright told

want to make changes, give you another offer, and that’s okay, I understand that, I really understand that.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In announcing his departure, Wright said he will have his final show in September and that the BBC has ‘always been fair and kind’ to him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He will continue working for the broadcaster, promising ‘new projects’ in October.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He will also still present Love Songs on Sunday mornings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fans of the DJ, who has been with the corporation for more than 40 years after joining in 1980 to present a Radio 1 Saturday night show, said they will stop listening to the afternoon slot when he leaves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One called it a ‘diabolical’ decision, with another Tweeting: ‘Ending his show is a terrible mistake BBC. There goes your audience.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another listener said: ‘His show is honestly what gets me through my work each day. Once he’s gone, the radio will be turned off for good.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He should’ve had his job for life,’ another added.
