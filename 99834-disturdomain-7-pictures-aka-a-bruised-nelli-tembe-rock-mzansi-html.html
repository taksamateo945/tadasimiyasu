The screenshots are accompanied by a picture of a bruised Nelli Tembe.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i>News24</i>, the original video was shared to them by a friend of Nelli's. Since then screenshots from the video have been circulating on social media and have left many concerned about the nature of the relationship the young couple shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/552f6de57c933f3a.jpg><p class=align-left>In the photos, AKA can be seen breaking down a door and charging through it towards the camera. In a separate photo, a bruised Nelli Tembe can be seen holding what looks like an ice pack to her face.</p><p class=align-left>Social media users have shared their thoughts about the shocking pictures. Check out some of the reactions:</p><p class=align-left>@VinceRaselabe said:</p>"So Kiernan broke in to take pictures of Anele, or was there a third person in the room?"<p class=align-left>@NgomaTumelo said:</p>"Let's not jump into conclusions! Nothing in the photos links AKA to Anele. There's no evidence that indicates that the person in the room is Anele. For all we know, it could be him fighting with his family member or friend. Better yet, someone could be trapped in that room."<p class=align-left>@lubritselane said:</p>"Before they got married? Why did she continue with the marriage."<p class=align-left>@WarrenJonathann said:</p>"I remember reading on the TL when it broke news that fatal day, a lot made comparison to Reeva. GBV is so deeply rooted in SA. Prevention and education needs to be taught at school level."<p class=align-left>@mokonelkomane said:</p>"He killed the lady by pushing her off the balcony. No doubt."<p class=align-left>@AskariMatamela said:</p>"Anywhere drugs are involved there is always drama."<p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that AKA left fans a little confused on Saturday, when <a href=#>he released another statement discussing the death of Anele</a> 'Nelli' Tembe.</p><p class=align-left>The statement slammed suggestions that he had anything to do with her passing. It all became clear on Sunday morning when a local publication reported that they were in possession of a video showing AKA allegedly abusing the late Tembe.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
