"He is 18 months."</p><p>"This is our first family pet," explains Richie, mom to daughter <strong>Harlow</strong>, 4, and son <strong>Sparrow</strong>, 3 (with husband <a href=#><strong>Joel Madden</strong></a>, 33). "He's a great dog. I've only had him about a week but he's so sweet."</p><p>"He's really Joel's dog," she continues. "I actually told Joel, 'I don't want to pick up after any thing ever again. I've got my kids so I'm going to let you do that.' It's his dog, but I like to, you know, snuggle. I like to hug him and kiss him."</p><p>Though Sparrow "was really excited" to welcome the canine, Harlow "did not want a dog," Richie admits. "She's very delicate. She doesn't like anything disturbing her space. Delicate would be the best way to put it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Host <a href=#><strong>Ellen</strong> <strong>DeGeneres</strong></a>, 54, then jokes that Richie "really respected [Harlow's] wishes" by bringing home the pooch. "I like to make my kids happy," Richie laughs. "I'm a really good mom, you guys!"</p><p>"Big dogs are much more calm than little dogs," Richie adds.</p><p>According to Richie, Harlow may change her mind in time.
