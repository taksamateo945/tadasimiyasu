Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield and Juraj Slafkovsky can be a solid starting point, but they need more. Necas would be a great addition, and if he really is available, the Canadiens should be making a strong offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp9cYOMamStqpGZsm61w56YZp6fp3qmwsSrsGaslZa6bsPArZqhoZ6cerW0xGaqrZmeobK6ecKup2aemaOurQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chino-pacas.html><span>←</span><span>Chino Pacas Age, Height, Name, Net Worth, GF, Wiki &amp;amp; Bio</span></a>
