You’re an inspiration to women out there struggling.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8FIQrwnc5Y/</p><p>This backer claimed: “Even though I have never met you but I watch the show, I’m one of your biggest fans. I’m a mother of two adult children. Sometimes it’s hard to tell a child to move on with their life because you cannot change a man. Dennis has made to many slips, and finally, he fell into a life you don’t know about. Move on to greater things in life. God got you to trust him to believe what he said, Trust Me, to do the impossible. Heal your wounds and keep going. Love your baby because you are going to need each other. I know you have a Mom as well. I’m sure you can lay on her shoulders anytime because she loves you, and I do too. Be Bless my child. Praying for you daily.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B73rJgcnE7e/</p><p>Andy Cohen’s recently revealed that Porsha was almost fired from the Bravo show after her first season. A source spoke to Hollywood Life and said this is how she reacted to Andy spilling the tea: “Porsha knew at the time she was potentially on the chopping block because there was a lot of chatter that her storyline was slow and not as dramatic as the other ladies. She had trouble fitting in and felt it was because she was new. Because of husband Kordell [Stewart], she knew she wasn’t the most popular housewife, and at the time, she was competing with Kenya Moore who was also in her first season and came in as a fan favorite with guns blazing and that just wasn’t Porsha.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B72d24SnRmD/</p><p>The insider added: “Porsha knew at the time she was potentially on the chopping block because there was a lot of chatter that her storyline was slow and not as dramatic as the other ladies.

Kordell also hated doing the show, so she struggled with sharing so much and really being herself, and there was a lot going on with them behind the scenes she didn’t want to share at the time. The show didn’t end her marriage, but they fought about filming all of the time, so she felt she couldn’t be who she wanted to be. But she is confident she will continue to hold her peach now. A lot has changed.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Porsha has a cute family and supporters love their vibe.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegpL%2B0tMBmrqKknJ6urr%2BMqaasrKNirqW70ZqZpZ1dpbWwwM6sZKieXZmutrPHrZyrZaCeuaK%2BjKOfnqaRYq6nwMSrZKGdomK%2FsLnAp5qeZaeewal5xLFkoa2jl66vsIykpquclaG5br%2FTnq6aqqRitrR50Z6fmquYmrFuf5VwZ3FvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julia-goldani-telles-rajahnae-patterson.html><span>←</span><span>JULIA GOLDANI TELLES, RAJAHNAE PATTERSON Celeb Secrets</span></a>
