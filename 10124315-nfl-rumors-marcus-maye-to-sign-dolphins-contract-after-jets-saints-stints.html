Maye reportedly "had multiple teams interested" in him but believes the Dolphins can contend for a Super Bowl title this season.</p><p>A second-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft, Maye spent the first five years of his career with the Jets before joining the Saints for the last two seasons.</p><p>In 2023, Maye was limited to seven games and recorded 37 total tackles, two interceptions, two passes defended and a sack. He was <a href=# rel=noopener>suspended</a> for three games due to a violation of the league's substance abuse policy, and he was <a href=# rel=noopener>placed</a> on injured reserve in December due to a shoulder injury. New Orleans <a href=# rel=noopener>released</a> him in February, ending his stint with just 17 appearances over his two years with the franchise.</p><p>Maye adds depth to a Dolphins safety group that includes former Buffalo Bills veteran Jordan Poyer and fourth-year starter Jevon Holland. With a cornerback tandem of seven-time Pro Bowler Jalen Ramsey and veteran Kendall Fuller, Miami has one of the deepest and most talented defensive backfields in the AFC.</p><p>The Dolphins are hoping to make a deeper run in the playoffs after their promising 2023 campaign came to an end in the AFC Wild Card Round against the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. Miami hasn't won a playoff game since the 2000 season, so Maye will be trying to help the team change that in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmAcoGMp52lZaKqurC%2B0makmqqTqsBuucCynGasn2LAqrPNZpuopKCdtq%2B%2FjJymp6yilrC1ecCfq56qXZ%2Bytb%2BMrJiipqSoerTAyKerrHeimrN%2Bwc%2Bsq6uZk6l7pLvM</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jfrd-firefighter-battling-for-ptsd-benefits-gets-backing-from-state-leader.html><span>←</span><span>JFRD firefighter battling for PTSD benefits gets backing from state leader</span></a>
