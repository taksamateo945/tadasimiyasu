The jury reached a decision after Robison took the stand in her own defense and shed tears while calling Tori the “perfect child” and “real easy to get along with.”</p><p>Robinson was sentenced to life in prison by the presiding judge.</p><p></p><p>As CrimeOnline previously reported, Ariel was charged with homicide by child abuse in January 2021 after Tori’s death. Robinson’s husband, 35-year-old Jerry “Austin” Robinson, pleaded guilty in April to a charge of aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.</p><p>Investigators believe that the child died from blunt force trauma. Prosecutors allege that the couple beat the 3-year-old girl with so much force that her blood vessels burst.</p><p>“If we lose enough blood,&nbsp;the heart doesn’t have enough volume to pump,” Greenville County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Ward testified, according to NBC 4.</p><p>The child was found unresponsive at the couple’s home on January 14, 2021. Austin reportedly told police that the beating was triggered by an incident a day earlier when the girl vomited on the way to church.</p><p>Ariel became angry and took the child into a church bathroom to clean her dress. A witness testified that she asked Ariel whether Tori was sick, and Ariel replied that the girl plays a “game” in which she “eats too much and makes herself throw up.”</p><p>The witness testified what she heard Ariel say to the child: “I heard Ariel say, ‘Oh, you’re cold? You’re cold? Girls who make themselves throw up deserve to be cold,’” the witness said. “I remember thinking, I wonder why she’s talking to her in that kind of tone.”</p><p>Austin also testified that his wife would grow angry with the girl’s eating behavior and beat her with a wooden paddle and belts.</p><p>“Sometimes I’d take a piece of (her) food just to help her out,” Austin testified, according to WHNS-TV.</p><p>Ariel, a former teacher, won $25,000 on the “Worst Cooks in America” season 20, a show that challenges amateur cooks against each other.</p><p>The story is developing.
