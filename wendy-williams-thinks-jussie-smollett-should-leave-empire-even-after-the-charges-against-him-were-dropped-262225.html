As you remember, the actor was accused of staging a hate crime against him because he was unhappy with his salary on the show."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jussie will be judged for the rest of his life. I venture to say, even if he gets acting roles, they are probably not going to be productions. They are just going to throw him in stuff that he will be forced to take because he will need money.’</p><p>The host still managed to find a silver lining in all of this, however.</p><p>‘Jussie’s thing with the law has definitely benefitted in terms of everyone talking about you, you are the lead story on everything. If I were him I would quit [Empire]. Let him just walk away and not make the staff and crew and his fellow actors suffer because everyone is divided on the set. It makes for a nasty situation when a nasty situation is going on.’</p><p>After Smollett’s lawyer confirmed via HollywoodLife that all the charges against his client had been dropped, the actor also insisted that, throughout the investigation, he has been ‘truthful on every level.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you agree with Wendy that he should quit Empire or not?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnToaCno6Nit7a%2F0qKcZqudpLmtsdOtZKygn6q5pXnLnpivnV2aurG10Z5knq6Vo3qistOeqWasmJp6pLTAq56eq12WtKK1zayrZqCZonq4sdGeZJ2qn6W9prCMa21ramJqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dateline-secrets-uncovered-what-happened-to-fast-food-restaurant-worker-robin-hoynes.html><span>←</span><span>Dateline: Secrets Uncovered - What happened to fast food restaurant worker Robin Hoynes?</span></a>
