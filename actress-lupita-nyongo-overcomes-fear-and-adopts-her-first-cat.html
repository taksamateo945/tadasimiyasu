She thanked her good friend Palmer Hefferan, who took her through the process of first visiting animal shelters. This led to her fostering a ginger cat named Yoyo from Best Friends Animal Society. Then it only took three days before Lupita declared Yoyo’s new (Wakanda) forever home is with her! She goes on to share that Yoyo has helped her as much as she helped Yoyo. And despite their short time together, Lupita has gotten to know Yoyo quite well, including his particular taste in cat teaser wand toys.</p><p>I never understood people whose phones were full of photos and videos of their pets – now I am one of those people! It may look like I saved Yoyo, but really, Yoyo is saving me.</p>@lupitanyongo, Instagram, October 2023<p>Plenty of celebrities, friends, and fans, gave their congratulations in the comments, such as pet adoption advocate<a href=#> Sarah Paulson</a> saying, “love this so much.” With a nod to Lupita’s public breakup with Selema Masekela earlier in October, @ariannagab commented, “Welcome to pet parenthood! Animals are the best solution for a healing heart.” Gabby Sidibe commented, “A love like you’ve never known! I’m so excited for you!! And super excited for YoYo!!!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCpnaSoe6%2Bx02iYnKyimsC0ecuup6KskWK7urvNoKZmp6aav6S7zJ6qZp6Vlr9urc2dZJqcn6XBtHnHnqlmnpmnwLV5wpqraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./175510-former-skeem-saam-star-opens-nature-resort-limpopo.html><span>←</span><span>Former Skeem Saam Star Cornet Mamabolo Opens Nature Resort in Limpopo Called Mabodibane Resort</span></a>
