They are used while playing gigs, practicing at home, and in a studio.</span></p><p><span>Drums are loud acoustic instruments, so playing them can be challenging. An </span><a href=#><span>in-ear monitor for drummer</span></a><span> is an amazing solution to simplify this process.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebspodium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/In-Ear-Monitors.jpg alt=In-Ear-Monitors width=1280 height=853 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>For some drummers, especially for beginners, it might be challenging to choose the right monitoring system. So here’s a buyer’s guide that will help you make a choice.</span></p><h2><span>What Are In-Ear Monitoring Systems?</span></h2><p><span>It can hardly be argued that it is much more comfortable to play the drum kit when you can clearly hear both the sound of your own instrument and other performers of the band. In-ear monitors, also called IEMs, are basically professional earbuds.</span></p><p><span>They are widely used during live performances since they help you reduce stage volume and achieve a clear mix. Then monitor mixes are delivered to the performer’s ears. So a nice set of in-ear monitors will help a drummer to hear the rest of the band since they won’t be drowned out by such a loud instrument.</span></p><h2><span>Do I Need In-Ear Monitors?</span></h2><p><span>In-ear monitors are quite a wise investment for a professional drummer. If you often practice playing drums, play gigs, or record in a studio, you’ll find them very useful. During gigs, the monitors will give you a clear sound of yourself and all the other instruments on the stage.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebspodium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/In-Ear-Monitors3.jpg alt=In-Ear-Monitors3 width=890 height=673 sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>In addition, your ears will be protected from loud noise. The same relates to the recording at a studio. Moreover, they are helpful not only in protecting the ears during practicing but also in playing along to songs.</span></p><h2><span>How to Choose In-Ear Monitors?</span></h2><p><span>For the monitors to be really useful and not just a waste of money, you have to choose them carefully. Here are some of the main features that need to be considered before buying in-ear monitors.</span></p><h3><span>Soundproofing</span></h3><p><span>There are different soundproofing methods. For example, on-ear monitors are closed-type headphones, they completely cover the auricle.</span></p><p><span>This design reduces the noise level in the headphones. An in-ear option fits into the auricle once it’s inserted into the ear opening, and it is fixed with a wire cord in a comfortable position. These monitors are less soundproof but still enough for their purpose.</span></p><h3><span>Convenience</span></h3><p><span>Drummers can spend quite a long time in the monitors: some concerts go on from 30 minutes to 2-3 hours, or studio recording sessions may last for the whole day.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, it is very important how comfortable the in-ear monitors are. Of course, each person has subjective characteristics and requirements for comfort, so you’ll have to try them out before buying.</span></p><h3><span>Durability</span></h3><p><span>Drummers have to use their IEMs often. Every gig, rehearsal, and recording session will make you use them all the time. So the importance of durability of the product can’t be overrated.</span></p><p><span>Before purchasing the product, check out the reviews about a particular brand, make sure that the quality is on a high level, and only afterward, make up your mind.</span></p><h2><span>Play with Comfort</span></h2><p><span>No matter how confusing it might seem for a beginner drummer, choosing the right in-ear monitors isn’t that difficult. You have to make sure to do previous research about some of the brands, so you’ll know what IEMs are worth your attention.</span></p><p><span>And remember, that this is an important investment, so spending some extra time to find the best option for you is very beneficial.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FPqJuirZ1jsLC5jpyfqKejnruoecinZJ6ZomK6sLrIraarq12Xwrqx0axkoK2ZmbJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-things-didnt-know-griffin-gluck.html><span>←</span><span>10 Things You Didnt Know about Griffin Gluck</span></a>
