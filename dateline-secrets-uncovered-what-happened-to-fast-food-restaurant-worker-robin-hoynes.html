The episode’s official synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“It takes an unique eye to see the object that’s out of place at a crime scene; in this case, that thing looks so insignificant, no one even knows what it is or what it signifies; it takes a team of determined investigators almost two decades to find out,” the book’s subtitle reads.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-48447 alt="Robin Hoynes was murdered in 1984" width=700 height=342 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Robin-Hoynes-was-murdered-in-1984-700x342.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-48447 class=wp-caption-text>Robin Hoynes was murdered in 1984</p><h2>Dateline: Secrets Uncovered&nbsp;– Who was Robin Hoynes, and what happened to her?</h2><p>In 1984, Robin Lucille Hoynes, a Whittier native, was 21 years old and employed by Kentucky Fried Chicken in Torrance, California, as an assistant manager. She was brutally murdered on October 30, 1984, by William Charles Marshall, a former coworker.</p><p>Hoynes allowed Marshall in after hours the night of the murder as she was completing paperwork on the pretence that he was picking up his briefcase and removing his uniform after being dismissed on suspicion of stealing money. Hoynes was assassinated in a surprise attack by Marshall, who had come to loot the location.</p><p>The victim in the murder of Robin Hoynes had two back stab wounds, one of which was fatal and the other possibly fatal, according to the medical examiner. At the time of her death or shortly after, her throat was slashed.</p><p>Cheryl Fuller, another assistant manager at the fast food business who had switched shifts with Hoynes that evening, found Hoynes’ body the next day.</p><h3>How Robin Hoynes’ killer was caught</h3><p>Although William Marshall was the main suspect in the killing of Hoynes, no charges were brought against him at the time, thus he was taken into custody and eventually freed. In addition, Marshall’s alibi failed to place him at the crime scene that evening.</p><p>Marshall managed to elude justice for more than 20 years with the aid of his then-girlfriend and the lack of adequate evidence to prosecute him.</p><p>Did Stacey Schoeck pay a hitman to kill her fifth husband, Richard Schoeck, according to Dateline Secrets Uncovered?</p><p>His ex-girlfriend Yvonne Williams also gave evidence against him in court and described the crime in detail. Back in 1984, Marshall had informed her of the stabbing and requested her to stand in for him. After Hoynes’ death, the drug-using pair continued to be together for another three years.</p><p>After four weeks of testimony, a jury ultimately found Marshall guilty of killing Hoynes in 2007, and he was given a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJGpsq21zZ5krJ2Tp7K1v4yupZynppq%2FprCMsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWkpHqnrdKtZJ%2Bnn5l6s7HSrZiuqpGjwW7Dzquinqpdp7yjtc1mn6ixnprAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./proof-locs-are-versatile-chloe-bailey-debuts-new-hairstyle-and-fans-love-it.html><span>←</span><span>Proof Locs Are Versatile: Chloe Bailey Debuts New Hairstyle, and Fans Love It</span></a>
