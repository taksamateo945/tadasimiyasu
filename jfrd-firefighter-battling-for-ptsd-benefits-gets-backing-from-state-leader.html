“Sometimes we need to show them that we’ve got their back,” said Jimmy Patronis, who is Florida’s chief financial officer and state fire marshal. “[First responders] have our backs technically 24/7, 365 days a year every time we dial 911.”
Patronis filed an “Amicus Curiae Brief” on July 30. It is also known as a “friend of the court brief” that voices his support&nbsp;for first responders getting benefits for any mental and nervous injuries."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We are not trying to weigh in on the character of any of the individuals. We are not trying to be critical of any of the parties. We are just saying that this is the law that was passed by the Florida legislature. This is how we interpreted it on how it is supposed to work.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Patterson is appealing the judge’s decision to the Florida first court of appeals.</p><p>Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4JAX – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmpu%2FpXnFoqmenpmctbWx0WaZmqykobavs4yfpqtloKnApXnBnqWenpmpwG6zxK2qZpqRmLiqusZmnaunnWLAta3TnmSlnZGZsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teal-travis-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Teal Travis Obituary: What Happened To Teal Travis?</span></a>
