And I’m a caring friend, and that kind of, I’m like, ok really? You too said that?”</p><p>The star added, “Hopefully I don’t make everyone’s problems about myself, because that would not be smart.”</p><p>Regarding her fight at Garcelle’s party, Sutton expressed, “I regret that Kyle came into the conversation. I don’t think she was in a place that night to have a deep conversation that I was trying to have with Diana … and that part was hard to watch back. But I just wanted to work things out.”</p><p>Does Sutton feel that the backlash against Kyle was warranted?</p><p>“Yeah. And I think that Kyle has, I think she feels really badly about her behavior, and she’s apologized to me. We’re good friends, and we’ve moved on. So, it’s so interesting how the audience gets so involved … I think the biggest takeaway is we should never touch each other like that in such an aggressive way. Because it doesn’t help. That didn’t solve any problems.”</p><p>Sutton then addressed Diana’s accusation in the fight (she hinted that Sutton wants to find a new villain).</p><p>“That was so, um, I was taken aback by that [claim]. I didn’t want to have a new villain. I’m like, look no I did that last year with someone, and I want to have friends and have fun.”</p><p>She also discussed her lunch with Diana, which happened soon after.</p><p>“I really wanted to work things out, and that didn’t go well either. [Diana and I] just butt heads,” said Sutton. “Well I don’t want her to head-butt me. You know I don’t think violence is the answer.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills <a href=# rel=noopener>season 12</a> airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq6WpwbC6jKyrq5mToLJuu81mqaGnkp16pK3SrWStmZygtq%2BzjJucoaGemXqpsdFmmZqbm2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./107850-doctors-warn-dangers-milk-crate-challenge-head-bleeding-risks-html.html><span>←</span><span>Doctors Warn of the Dangers of the Milk Crate Challenge: Head Bleeding Risks</span></a>
