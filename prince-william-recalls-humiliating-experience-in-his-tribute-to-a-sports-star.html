Magazine.</p><p>Luckily, there are no hard feelings on the duke’s part. In fact, William has been a big supporter of Scott’s team,&nbsp;the Lionesses, through the years. He&nbsp;filmed a video with his daughter, Princess Charlotte, to wish them team good luck during the Euro finals, and William was on hand to present them with their medals after their win over Germany.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqKKeu6SxjLCgpaSZlrpuvsScmKWko2K1trnIpaCarJmjtG6x16mcq6GVo7CmecinZKGho2LBs7XBrqueZaSkeqJ50qmmq6yjYsC1rdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./outer-part-of-a-watermelon-html.html><span>←</span><span>Outer part of a watermelon</span></a>
