What should I do?</p><p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=#>May 1, 2021</a></p><p>Redd’s tweet comes after his&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;co-stars first dropped hints they were less than pleased with Musk’s upcoming appearance on the show, which was first announced April 24 to immediate backlash. Shortly after the news broke, Musk tweeted “Let’s find out just how live Saturday Night Live really is ?.” In response,&nbsp;SNL‘s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bowen Yang</a> posted a screenshot of the tweet on his Instagram story, writing, “What the fuck does this even mean?”</p><p>Yang was hardly alone in his reaction, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aidy Bryant</a> seemingly sharing her disappointment with her own Instagram story. Bryant’s post featured a screenshot of a Bernie Sanders’ tweet calling out the “moral obscenity” of the 50 wealthiest people in America owning “more wealth than some 165 million Americans,” a dig at Musk’s billionaire status.</p><p>And cast member Andrew Dismukes cracked his own joke about Musk hosting, sharing a photo of Cheri Oteri and writing, “Only CEO I want to do a sketch with is Cher-E Oteri.”</p><p>Despite the cast backlash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reports that&nbsp;SNL stars won’t have to perform alongside Musk on Saturday if they don’t want to. “Speaking historically, if a cast member has been that unhappy, they don’t have to do it,” a source said. “SNL boss Lorne Michaels] won’t ever make them do anything they don’t want to do.”</p><p>No matter how Musk’s episode turn out, it’s sure to be an interesting one. Tune in to see the Tesla CEO host this Saturday, May 8 at 11:30/10:30c.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where to watch&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;<br></a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk52%2Fqr%2BMq5ydnF2nvKK%2F06xknqSfo3quwdKkZJqglZaxbrvFZp%2Biq12ou615x6iqraGenHqotcZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ian-charles.html><span>←</span><span>Ian Jeffrey Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
