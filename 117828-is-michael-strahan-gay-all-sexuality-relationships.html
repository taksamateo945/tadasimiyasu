So, how old is Michael Strahan? He is 50 years old as of 2021. He attended Westbury high school and later Texas Southern University.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Michael Strahan was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">drafted into the NFL</a> in 1993 and played for only one club, New York Giants, until he retired in 2007. He broke records and set new ones yet to be surpassed to date, which has earned him a place in the Pro Hall of Fame. After retirement, Michael <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took a shot</a> in sports analysis, movie production and directing, writing and shone brightly there too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5f44507eaa833ec8.jpg><h2>Is Michael Strahan married?</h2><p class=align-left>The wealthy television host has been married twice and divorced, though the second was the most tumultuous. Below we reveal some of Michael’s relationships.</p><h3>Wanda Hutchins</h3><p class=align-left>The ever-smiling giant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married his first love</a>, Wanda, in Germany in 1992. The duo fell out of love around 1996 but not after having <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two children</a> together: Tanita and Michael Jr. According to a social media post from the former New Yorker, Tanita is an artist. Michael Strahan Jr's partner is Lucia Garcia, and he is just 26 years old since he was born in 1995.</p><h3>Jean Muggli</h3><p class=align-left>Three years after separating from his first wife, Michael found love in the heart of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jean Muggli</a>. The duo met in 1999 and was together for about seven years until they walked down the path of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a messy divorce </a>in 2006.</p><p class=align-left>Their union was blessed with twins in 2004. Isabella and Sophia are now teenagers who celebrated their 17th birthday in 2021.</p><p class=align-left>The divorce process between Michael and his second wife was hectic and the most challenging period of the retired footballer's life. Both parties accused themselves of many atrocities within and outside the marriage.</p><p class=align-left>One of the most shocking questions that popped up during this separation process was, “Is Michael Strahan married to a man?” This interrogative statement may appear alarming now, but it was exactly what Jean insinuated when she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accused her husband </a>of being gay. Michael has since denied this accusation publically.</p><p class=align-left>Michael fired back and accused Jean of emotionally abusing their twins and demanded full custody for the kids such that Jean would only have visiting rights to them.</p><p class=align-left>In the end, Jean was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">awarded a $15.3 million compensation</a>, plus $18,000 monthly for upkeeps and the likes. This sum was reduced after Michael retired from active footballing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/dcfe38661608e5db.jpg><p class=align-left>Some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other women</a> that the father of four had started a relationship with include:</p><h3>Nicole Mitchell</h3><p class=align-left>The television host <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hooked up with Nicole</a>, the former wife of famous actor Eddie Murphy. The lovebirds engaged for some years until they went their separate ways sometime in 2014, although they are still good friends.</p><h3>Mariana Hewitt</h3><p class=align-left>Michael Strahan's girlfriend Marianna Hewitt is the Chief Executive Officer at Summer Fridays, and she is also a podcaster. They dated for about five to six years before ending it.</p><h2>Is Michael Strahan dating?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, he is. So, who is Michael Strahan's partner now? It is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kayla Quick</a>. She had been with Michael for six years when the duo’s pictures went public as they spent time together at The Hollywood Fix in 2015.</p><h3>Michael Strahan’s net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Michael is a retired American football player and talk show host who played defensive end for the New York Giants for fourteen seasons.
