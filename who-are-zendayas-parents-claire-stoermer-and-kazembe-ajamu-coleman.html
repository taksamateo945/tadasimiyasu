The duo became very famous following the sudden rise to fame of their prolific and multitalented daughter, Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman, who has become one of Hollywood’s most sought-after movie actresses.</strong></p><p>Zendaya is the youngest two-time winner of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. In so doing, her parents have become one of the internet’s most sought-after people.</p><p><strong>Who is Zendaya’s Real Mom Claire Stoermer?</strong></p><ul><li><b>Full name:&nbsp;</b>Claire Stoermer Coleman</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Female</li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>Born March 24, 1964</li><li><b>Claire Stoermer Coleman’s Age: </b>59 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>White</li><li><b>Nationality:&nbsp;</b>American<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></li></ul><p>Claire Stoermer is the 59 year-old mother of Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman. She was born on March 24, 1964, in Oakland, California, as reported by multiple sources. Although Oakland, California, is where she currently lives, some reports have it that Claire was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where she spent her early life as a child.</p><p>Not much is known about her parents, siblings, and her entire family background. However, she is reported to be of Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry, with many details of her personal life kept away from the media and the public.</p><p>As we noted earlier, Claire kept much information about her early childhood days a secret from the public. To this extent, not much is known about her early educational background, the type of education she had, the schools she went to, or where she had them. But as a teacher, she made sure her daughter got the education she needed to succeed in life.</p><p>Her childhood educational achievements may have eluded the media and the public. Nevertheless, many reports have it that Claire Stoermer was a senior at the University of Missouri. She is reported to have studied journalism with a major in strategic communication. The report also has it that she has an interest in writing and media.</p><h3><strong>What Does Claire Stoermer Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Claire Stoermer is a Fruitville Elementary School teacher in Oakland, California. It is uncertain when she started working as a teacher there, be that as it may, she is reported to have spent over 20 years working as a school teacher at Fruitville Elementary School in Oakland, California. A school Zendaya also attended during her early schooling days.</p><p>Multiple reports have it that besides her teaching job at Fruitville Elementary, Claire also works as the house manager at the California Shakespeare Theater in Orinda, California. This gives the widespread opinion that Zendaya’s upbringing, while her mother worked in theatre, provided her with the perfect acting foundation.</p><p>At the California Shakespeare Theatre, where her mother worked, Zendaya started working as a part-time actress. Her interest in performing was sparked by her involvement in the theater. The young actress recalls watching her mother teach her students about the arts and also helped them understand Shakespeare’s language.</p><p>Claire is also a writer, which is something she enjoys doing in her spare time. It is reported that she interned during her time at the University of Missouri with the Columbia Missourian and also KBIA 91.3FM, where she provided written articles on various topics. She also has an online Jewelry store called Kizzmet Jewelry, where she sells jewelry made from crystals such as amethysts, hematites, and chrysocollas.</p><h3><strong>Claire’s Relationship With Her Daughter Zendaya Before and After Her Rise To Fame</strong></h3><p>Claire shares a heavy but warm bond with her daughter. They have a close-knit relationship, but she is very private about her personal life. Claire is very protective of her daughter, they even share the same protective affinities for each other.</p><p>The mother of the Euphoria star has received warm words from her daughter about the influence and upbringing she got from them. In her own words, everything she is today is because of her parents. Claire’s daughter admittedly said she felt lucky to have them as her parents. It is obvious that Claire and her husband really did instill standards and discipline in their daughter. The disciplines she now exhibits in her career.</p><p>Clair’s unique personality was also copied by her daughter while growing up. Her superstar daughter admits to watching her while she teaches in the heart of Oakland, California, at inner-city schools that were always underfunded. She has always won the admiration of Zendaya for going above and beyond, constantly working to open her students’ eyes to an education that could lift them far beyond their current circumstances.</p><p>Claire also taught Zendaya a thing or two about beauty and outward appearance. It is without wonder how fascinating her daughter appears in shows and gala nights. According to Zendaya, her beauty icons are the women in my life, which include her mother. Claire does not wear makeup, she may not be self-conscious about it, but it somehow influenced her daughter into not wearing makeup as well, who described it as empowering to her.</p><h2><strong>Meet Zendaya’s Father Kazembe Ajamu Coleman</strong></h2><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Kazembe Ajamu Coleman</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of birth: </b>Born February 10, 1960</li><li><b>Kazembe Ajamu Coleman’s Age: </b><span>63 years old</span></li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>African American</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>American</li></ul><p>Kazembe Ajamu Coleman is an African American agent, manager, and former teacher from Oakland, California. Coleman has a lot of life accomplishments, it may not come as a surprise that his daughter, Zendaya, exhibits a wide range of talents. He is a loving and doting father who made sure to support and mentor his daughter in all aspects when she began her career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>The 63 year-old was earlier reported to be from Oakland, California, it is uncertain if that is where he was born. Not much has been discovered about his early life and family background. To this level, no information is available about his parents, siblings, or other family members or relatives.</p><p>He is mostly private about his personal life and affairs and never tries to reveal specific details on his social media accounts. Coleman has no known educational information available to the public. He has not shared anything about his educational background and what qualifications he has. But we are quite certain that he went to school and acquired the necessary education that qualifies him to become a teacher.</p><h3><strong>Is Zendaya’s father Nigerian?</strong></h3><p>Zendaya’s father, Kazembe Ajamu Coleman, is an American and not a Nigerian. However, Zendaya’s dad traced his ancestral roots back to Nigeria on the continent of Africa. The 63 year-old celebrity father is of mixed ethnicity, with his mother being said to be from Nigeria, while his father is reported to be from Iceland.</p><p>After his successful quest of roots tracing, Kazembe was happy to change his name from Samuel David Coleman to Kazembe Ajamu Coleman. According to multiple sources, the name is said to be a Yoruba name from Nigeria. Other sources have it that Kazembe means “he is an ambassador,” and Ajamu translates to “God of strength.”</p><h3><strong>What Does&nbsp;Kazembe Ajamu Coleman&nbsp;Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Kazembe was also a teacher like his wife Claire while his daughter Zendaya was growing up. When her career took off, he switched gears and began working as her manager. Kazembe was by his daughter’s side a lot at the beginning of her career, accompanying her to set, red carpet events, and more.</p><p>He is also a music producer and has contributed a lot to the development of his daughter’s talent in music. Coleman intends to nurture every bit of talent his daughter has aside from just being a supportive father, promo manager, and agent.</p><p>Multiple sources have it that he is also a bodyguard and a gym instructor, as indicated on a Facebook account that is rumored to belong to him and that his current client is his daughter. This, however, stems from the fact that Kazembe is very protective of his celebrity daughter, as he is mostly spotted by her side when she attends functions.</p><h3><strong>Kazembe’s Relationship With His Daughter Zendaya Before and After Her Rise To Fame</strong></h3><p>Kazembe Ajamu Coleman and Zendaya have a very close relationship. The father-daughter duo is often seen on the red carpet together. The closeness they share goes way back to when she was coming up before she became a sensation. Kazembe obviously was like a tour guide to his daughter, helping her maneuver through the entertainment industry to the top of an aspiring career.</p><p>Kazembe has been said to be overly protective of his daughter, but many will never understand a father’s love for his daughter. He keeps her away from cyber bullies and internet rumors. On one particular occasion, when Zendaya was the subject of wild internet rumors which speculated that she was dating Odell Beckham Jr., Kazembe was able to put things straight and kill off the rumor without being rude.</p><p>As much as her parents have been supportive and very protective of her, Zendaya is also supportive and protective of her parents in the same manner. A typical example was when she took on a set of Twitter trollers who described her parents as ugly back in 2015. She also supports their own works and businesses just like they do hers.</p><p>Because her parents have been there for her all her life, she has, on numerous occasions, expressed how grateful she is to them for their unconditional love, unwavering strength, protection, and words of wisdom toward her. In 2016, she took to her Instagram account to celebrate and thank her father on Father’s Day.</p><h2><strong>Zendaya’s Parents’ Relationship Lasted For Over 19 years, With 8 Years Of Marriage</strong></h2><p>Sometime around 2016, Claire Stoermer and Kazembe Ajamu Coleman made headlines as they both headed in the direction of ending their eight years of marriage. The pop star’s mother filed paperwork to legally split from Kazembe Ajamu Coleman in the third week of august 2016 after eight years of marriage.</p><p>Nothing was revealed by either of Zendaya’s parents as to why they were taking a break from the union. However, sources have it that the paperwork filed by Claire cited irreconcilable differences. Zendaya is the youngest of their children, and even though she is the only product of the union, she was 19 when they decided to call it quits, so child support won’t be an issue.</p><p>The details of how and when they first met have not been revealed by either of her parents due to how private they treat their personal lives. But rumors have it that they met over 19 years ago and dated for a period of 12 years before they both decided to tie the knot and become husband and wife.</p><p>Zendaya was was only 12 years old when her parents decided to get married, but because she had attained the age of adulthood, she won’t be caught in between their divorce tussles. The fact that she is old enough to make her own decisions made the whole divorce process seamless, and since neither of them asked for spousal support, it’s likely they worked out a settlement.</p><h3><strong>Zendaya is Their Only Daughter Together, But Coleman Has Five Children From His Previous Relationship</strong></h3><p>As previously mentioned, Kazembe is also the father of five other children from a previous relationship. He has three daughters – Katiana Stoermer Coleman, Anabella Stoermer Coleman, and Kaylee Stoermer Coleman. He also has two male children, Julien and Austin Stoermer Coleman.</p><p>They are all Zendaya’s half-siblings but much older than she is. Most, if not all, of Coleman’s children, have kids of their own, except for Zendaya. In fact, before she was born, two of Coleman’s children already had children of their own, which makes her a baby aunty at birth.</p><p>Not much is known about Claire’s previous relationship, if at all she had any before she met and married Coleman. She is the most private of Zendaya’s two parents, as she does not speak about her past life. Nevertheless the present circumstances, we keep our fingers crossed with our ears to the ground while we wait for more to unfold on Zendaya’s family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYq6zsYyznKecka6utHnPmqmepqSoeqS4wKKpnmWjqbymvsyeqWaZnpl6rK3ZnqSbnV2Wt6K51GaaqKSVoq6vew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-ogrady-quits-bbc-radio-2-show.html><span>←</span><span>Paul O'Grady QUITS BBC Radio 2 show</span></a>
