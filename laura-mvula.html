Laura also co-produced the track. Laura first formed a friendship with Nile Rodgers through their mutual love of music and each others work and she initially sent the song for him to listen to. Nile loved it so much that he wanted to get involved and add some of his magic to the&nbsp;final version!</p><p>Combining Nile’s upbeat sounds with Laura’s characteristic thrilling harmonies layered beneath stunning tribal beats may come as a surprise to many, but the final product is a true testament to both artists’ musical talents and a clear development from Laura’s debut album. Laura has come a long way since the critically acclaimed Sing To The Moon and whilst she is still reflecting on her distinctive signature sound, she is showing the progression of an artist who has come into her own.</p><p>Laura has such an&nbsp;undeniable uniqueness and her music is so lyrically poetic that it simply speaks for itself:</p><p>When your heart is broken down<br>And your head don’t reach the sky<br>Take your broken wings and fly</p><p>When your head is heavy, low<br>And the tears they keep falling<br>Take your broken feet and run</p><p>With the world upon your shoulders<br>Nowhere left to hide<br>Keep your head up carry on</p><p>It ain’t no time to die<br>Even though we suffer<br>Come together we pray</p><p>Laura Mvula is one of the most exciting musical talents to come out of the UK, and we wish her all the luck with her new single! ‘Overcome’ is out now to <a href=#>download</a>.</p><p>Take a listen to ‘Overcome’ below.</p><p></p><p>What are your thoughts?
