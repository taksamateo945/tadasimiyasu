The documentary was a fascinating look at his family life and journey to the height of his success as the company's top star.</p><p>Reigns has undeniably put all the pieces together during this run as The Head of the Table. It has been the best work of his career, but his cousin has overshadowed him in 2024 as The Final Boss.</p><p>His heel turn and subsequent move to join The Bloodline have been the highlight of this year's build to The Showcase of the Immortals. Rhodes still seeks to dethrone the undisputed universal champion to finish the story, but his conflict with The Great One has been much more entertaining since the WrestleMania Kickoff press conference on Feb. 8.</p><p>Sure, it started a little shaky when The American Nightmare seemingly stepped aside and handed his spot to someone else after he won the men's Royal Rumble match.</p><p>Nevertheless, The Rock vs. Rhodes had defined the Road to WrestleMania 40.</p><p><b>A Surprising Return to Form</b></p><p>The WWE Universe has been salivating over the prospect of a dream match featuring The Rock and Reigns for over three years. Just as the marquee encounter finally seemed more plausible than ever, Rhodes earned a highly anticipated rematch and divided the fanbase.</p><p>Initially, it was unclear how WWE could rectify the situation and give us a satisfying compromise. However, the upcoming tag team bout and the main event of Night 1 of this year's event is an excellent solution.</p><p>This star-studded stipulation match is the perfect way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of The Show of Shows with wrestlers from the past, present and future. It's also a fresh way to use the two-night format to tell an overarching story.</p><p>Even more, the current status quo adds even more depth to a future one-on-one showdown between The Great One and The Tribal Chief. Now, the match will feel even bigger when it does happen.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1712216842/f82t64nhjdr8w89qvlgu.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1712216842/f82t64nhjdr8w89qvlgu.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Photo credit: WWE.com</span><p>In the meantime, The Rock has stood out as the most magnetic character of the four and his segments with Rhodes have been the real selling point. In comparison, the exchanges between the champion and challenger to promote the follow-up to last year's title match have been underwhelming.</p><p>That's largely due to The Final Boss' commitment and promo work for the past two months. The 51-year-old hasn't come off as a returning celebrity; he has successfully reawakened the pro wrestler longtime fans idolized during the Attitude Era.</p><p>It would be easy to say he's merely relying on nostalgia to appease viewers who grew up watching him. Sure, there is some truth to that, but his dynamic with The Bloodline and tension with Rhodes have also been tremendous.</p><p>The closing moments of the March 25 episode of Raw led to the hottest cliffhanger the flagship series has produced in recent memory. That visual of The Brahma Bull standing over a bloodied Rhodes in the rain will leave a lasting impact on many fans long after WrestleMania 40 is done.</p><p><b>Can Rhodes Overcome The Latest Iteration of The Bloodline?</b></p><p>The outcome of The American Nightmare's conflict with The Bloodline is tougher to predict now. A tandem of two of the biggest stars of their respective eras is an imposing sight, but The Rock has outshined Reigns for most of this build.</p><p>That isn't necessarily a negative development because heel work has added another layer to Rhodes' quest to finish the story. His inclusion has also emphasized Seth Rollins' character growth and created a gratifying full-circle moment between himself and his rival.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1712216763/qbtepjntqgpvg4yjlnxm.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1712216763/qbtepjntqgpvg4yjlnxm.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Photo credit: WWE.com</span><p>No one would have guessed that The Visionary would side with the man he feuded with for most of 2022, but a common threat united them. The Final Boss is too powerful for either of them to face alone, and his self-indulgence forced the world heavyweight champion to humble himself.</p><p>It's an exceptional story that wouldn't have been possible if Rhodes and The Rock didn't clash over the main event spot. Their confrontation salvaged a seemingly disastrous situation and bolstered this year's WrestleMania card.</p><p>Time will tell if the 2024 men's Royal Rumble winner can overcome The Bloodline and achieve his childhood dream of winning the WWE Championship. Nonetheless, the last two months have unexpectedly been an incredible ride full of memorable moments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqCdX%2BMrZ%2BeZaKksKx51axknKeUrnqztM6dnKxlmJbAbrDEn6CnnZRiwamxjKummpxdqbxuw9aeZLCqlajBrbHMmqWimV2tuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jelly-roll-wife-before-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>In Pictures: Jelly Roll &amp;amp; His Wife Bunnie XOs Adorable Love Story</span></a>
