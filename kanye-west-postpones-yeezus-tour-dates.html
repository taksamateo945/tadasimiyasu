For those of you who remember Kanye’s tour opened last month in Seattle, but was derailed when a large LED screen was damaged in a traffic accident on the way to Vancouver. There are twenty-three dates remaining left in the tour that will include Kendrick Lamar who will open for Kanye. We’re still not convinced Kanye, with all his money and resources, needed to derail his tour, but what do we know.</p><p>Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKmno6m9sLrErGSynZWvwrR506isq2WUlsGmv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-maria-julia-mazalli-and-vinicius-jr-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Are Maria Jlia Mazalli And Vinicius Jr Dating?</span></a>
