Jackie Goldschneider, a longtime series housewife, will make room for the newly introduced housewives this season and serve as a companion to the women of the home.</p><h2>Meet Danielle Cabral, the RHONJ season 13 mom and businesswoman.</h2><p>37-year-old Danielle Cabral, a native of Staten Island, New York, is the mother of two children, a boy called Dominic and a daughter named Valentina.
