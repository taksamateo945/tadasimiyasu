The "Come & Get It" singer seemingly dissed one specific body shamer via Instagram on Thursday, April 30.</p><p>In a screenshot that's now gone viral, a commenter slammed the star for her weight. The commenter allegedly said that Gomez needed to "tone her body" because she's in the business. "You need to work out!" the person wrote. "Please stop eating junk food." Gomez was quick to reply — and didn't hold back.</p><p>"You're disgusting. IM IN the business and I could care less about what 'they' or you say I should look like," she allegedly wrote. "I don't need to do anything other than love myself, take care of my work, fans, family and friends."&nbsp;</p><p>She added: "And I do work out. It's not your place to tell anyone what they should or should not do."</p><p>The heated exchange comes just weeks after Gomez, 22, proudly showed off her curves in a revealing black swimsuit. "I love being happy with me yall #theresmoretolove," she captioned via Instagram on April 16. Last week, actress <strong>Abigail Breslin</strong> even stuck up for <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber's</strong></a> ex on her personal Tumblr account.</p><p>"Everyone is always saying how we shouldn't judge each other, so why are you commenting on a gorgeous, talented and smart young girl's body when she's on the beach having fun with her friend AND SHE LOOKS AMAZING. Aren't there more important things the world can be reporting on??" she wrote. "I think if we all took the time we spend making each other feel bad about ourselves and used it to make each other feel good, the world would be a better place."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKqepJWjrm6zzqacs2Wjoa6uv4ydoKyfpajBqrrGZpmonKliwKmtzJ6pZqeeYravv9OanquZnWJ%2FcX2Uamw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-fred-rogers-daily-routine.html><span>←</span><span>What Was Fred Rogers' Daily Routine?</span></a>
