He tries not to discuss his childhood, but he has spoken of the difficulties he has faced.</p><p>After his father abandoned them, he lived with his mother, and they were often left with little or no money. They sometimes didn’t have a place to sleep and had to eat noodles or nothing at all. The two were seen sleeping on patios while having to ask inside bars and cafes if they could charge their phones. All of this struggle is what motivated he to start writing lyrics.</p><p>He was in high school but lacked books because he couldn’t afford them, and his grades were bad. His classmates made fun of him for wearing old clothing, but he didn’t let it bother him. He got a job to help his mother financially, and he finally graduated from high school. After that, he was totally focused on his rap career, and he didn’t even bother going to college.</p><h2><span id=Death>Death</span></h2><p>Mo3 was killed on <strong>November 11, 2020,</strong> at the <strong>age of 28.</strong> When driving on Interstate 35 in Dallas, he was followed by another driver.
