<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Katie Mcneil (Neil Diamond Wife) Age and Wikipedia</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>You might be aware of the legendary singer <a href=#><strong>Neil Diamond</strong></a> if you’re a music lover. At the same time, you might be mindful of his personal life matters and updates. The singer is currently in a marital relationship with a lady 20 years younger than him and has proved that age is just a number and an insignificant factor of a relationship. His fans now demand to read about his current wife, <strong>Katie McNeil</strong>, and her Wikipedia biography. So we’ve covered everything you’d love to read down below.</p><h2>Katie Mcneil Age and Early life</h2><p>Katie McNeil was professionally known as Neil’s manager before she married him. However, after marriage, she is known as his loving wife. She is currently 51, born in 1970, whereas her husband, Neil Diamond, is 80 years of age. As for her early life, we came to know that she was born and raised in the United States. Apart from that, the facts regarding her upbringing, parents and educational history remains a secret. Moreover, she previously had an interest in music and thought of pursuing a career in it, but she moved differently.</p><h2>Katie Mcneil is married to Neil Diamond since 2012.</h2><p>Katie married the American Singer Neil in the year 2012. Back then, she was 42, and her husband was 71 years old. Their wedding ceremony took place at Beverly Hills Hotel, Los Angeles, and it was a private function with minimal numbers of guests, to be precise, just 225. So as we’ve mentioned above, she used to work as his manager before marriage; hence, the two of them first met while Katie was working as a video producer while filming a documentary based in Neil’s life. Eventually, they started being around each other more, and Neil asked her out on a date. It was only then; she was promoted to be his manager. Soon after knowing each other perfectly, they got hitched in September 2011 and wedded in April 2012.</p><p>Furthermore, Neil had been married twice before this, as his two previous relationships broke apart. Meanwhile, this was the first marital relationship of Katie. Before her, the singer married his high school love,&nbsp;<strong>Jayne Posner.&nbsp;</strong>He even shares two daughters with her. However, due to undisclosed reasons, they parted ways. Following this, he later wedded with a production assistant&nbsp;<strong>Marcia Murphey&nbsp;</strong>and conceived two sons. After 25 years of togetherness, he divorced his second wife as well.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-8169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Neil-Diamond-Katie-Mcneil-.jpg alt="Katie Mcneil with her husband, Neil Diamond" width=690 height=633 sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-8169 class=wp-caption-text>The American Singer Neil Diamond with his wife, Katie Mcneil</p><h2>Wikipedia and Career</h2><p>Unlike her husband, Katie is not documented on Wikipedia, but the brighter side is written on many wiki-bio pages. Now to talk about her career, she first hopped into a career as a music producer back in 1998. The first project she did was writing music for the movie&nbsp;Tonight at the House of Blues.</p><p>Later she also worked for the TV series&nbsp;Stone Temple&nbsp;and&nbsp;House of Yes: Live from the House of Blues&nbsp;in 2000. Moreover, in 2001, she produced music for&nbsp;Public Enemy: Live from House of Blues,&nbsp;The Psychedelic Furs: Live from the House of Blues, and&nbsp;Mötley Crüe: Lewd Crüed & Tattooed.&nbsp;As she gathered more experiences, she got opportunities like creating music for two music videos named&nbsp;Heart: Alive in Seattle&nbsp;and&nbsp;Check 1,2.&nbsp;She altogether has 13 credits as a music producer, reported by her&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income Sources</h2><p>While her husband Neil has a net worth of more than $175 million, Katie’s net worth is estimated to be just over&nbsp;<strong>$4 million</strong>. She generated this amount from her career as a music producer and as a manager of Neil Diamond. The lady has her career and is financially independent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jqSYraGVYrqkusSio2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./decades-brutal-racially-motivated-murder-timothy-coggins-grave-finally-gets-headstone.html><span>←</span><span>Decades After His Brutal Racially Motivated Murder, Timothy Coggins Grave Finally Gets Headstone</span></a>
