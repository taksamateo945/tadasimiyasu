In the ad, <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Rasta</a> plays the part of a sketch artist keen on banding with a local police station to put together portraits of wanted suspects.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><h2>'I did not feel offended'</h2><p class=align-left>The person interviewing him, presumably the station commander, falls into an imaginative state in which he conjures the scale of the backlog of unsolved cases that befalls the police station after struggling to catch the right suspect resulting from the artist's work.</p><p class=align-left>The advert ends with the words: "Choose your sketch artist wisely," as Rasta's application for the job is set aside by the station commander once he comes to, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">News24</a></i> reported.</p>"I'm happy to have been a part of it. I did not feel offended as it was all part of work. [If anything] I felt honoured. Like with anything, there'll be those who love it and others who disapprove of things I do," Rasta told <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimesLIVE</a></i>."I'd love to act. Growing up, I always enjoyed the theatre at the school I attended. I enjoy theatre and music and anything that calls on my artistic side. So, I might find myself acting one day."<h2>Netizens revel in excitement</h2><p class=align-left>Below, <strong>Briefly News</strong> takes a look at some of the hilarious, encouraging, and inspirational comments locals had to share.</p><p class=align-left>@SmilinGeorge_SA wrote:</p>"Are we sure South Africa is a real country?

Others were fun but this sent me to the ancestors."<h2>'Makhadzi' sculpture leaves Mzansi puzzled</h2><p class=align-left>Elsewhere, <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that a determined sculptor surfaced, leaving peeps drawing a stark correlation between Rasta and the supposed new kid on the block making hilarious waves online.</p><p class=align-left>Courtesy of Mzansi's very own 'The Cleaner', <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@RealMrumaDrive</a>, who took to Twitter to introduce <a href=#>the self-styled sculptor's handiwork</a> – a so-called sculpture of musician Makhadzi – netizens are falling off their seats.</p><p class=align-left>The caption read:</p>"Owen is not serious. Who's this now?"<p class=align-left>The tweet attracted an unprecedented frenzy online and instigated a torrent of laughter across the length and breadth of the bird app. The life-size sculpture showed Makhadzi holding a mic in one hand and rocking an orange two-piece skirt and crop top number with red Converse takkies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLS71K2fZpmWp7akrY5qaHJqZ2p6s63SrZhmqJyWu7R5z66prK2VYq6kwMinnmarkWKusbzLmqydq12Ytaqvyp6lZqSZmLimuoyam2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-battles-lupus-remember-october-lupus-awareness-month.html><span>←</span><span>As Selena Gomez Battles Lupus Remember That October Is Lupus Awareness Month</span></a>
