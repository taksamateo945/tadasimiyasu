In a new social media post, the professional golfer shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit while teasing the release of her 2024 calendar. "</span><span>Smiling because I love you guys so much! Thank you for all the amazing comments about my 2024 calendar," she captioned another </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>post</span></a><span>. How does the 30-year-old maintain her fit physique? Celebwell rounded up Paige Spiranac's top lifestyle habits.</span></p><p><span>Paige claims that "exercise and eating healthy" help her mental health. "My mood is significantly better when I workout daily and make sure I meal prep for the week," she said on </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Paige is one of the many celebrities who swear by intermittent fasting. "I start eating at 11am and I end eating at 7pm," she said during a What I Eat </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>YouTube video</span></a><span>. "I did it for three and a half weeks and I saw really good changes. I sleep better and my body feels better. It's fun to mix it up."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_734579047.jpg><p><span>Paige claims CBD oil is "a miracle." She added: "It's helped my relationship, my sleeping and my mood. It's helped my quality of life. She added that she "lives and dies" by CBD oil. "I feel like myself without the anxiety. When I was on medication, I didn't feel like myself. I hated that. With this I feel a little bit more calm. Now I take my 'liquid gold', my liquid CBD, and I feel so much better."</span></p><p><span>Paige meals preps, using canned veggies, pre-cooked rice, and frozen burritos. "I like things that are very easy," she said in her What I Eat video. "I think people are intimidated by healthy food because, one, it's expensive which is frustrating, but also it's time consuming to have fresh produce all the time and to make these health elaborate meals. I like to find hacks so I can make something that is healthy and also doesn't take a couple of hours."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Paige allows herself to cheat. Her go-to meal? "Definitely a hot dog. There is nothing better than a golf course hot dog. I can only eat my hot dogs with ketchup," she revealed on her </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Playing A Round</span></a><span> podcast. Paige, who has a massive seeet tooth, also loves ice cream. In one tweet she revealed that she had eaten ice cream for breakfast that day.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>"I don't drink alcohol pretty much at all," Paige said, revealing that she stopped drinking her senior year of college. "I hate being hungover. I don't like the feeling of it. I'm never really interested in drinking anymore," she admitted. "I think it's bettered my life. If you are ever struggling with your weight or mental health just try and cut alcohol out. It really helped me."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKi7y5%2Bcq2WglraosYysp6KqkaOupHnSoZirnaNiwLi1zKysoqxdpbWwwM5mmKxlnprEbq%2FApZynnJGnerOxy56YrJ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./23673-10-rebecca-malope-songs-ranked-html.html><span>←</span><span>10 best Rebecca Malope songs ranked</span></a>
