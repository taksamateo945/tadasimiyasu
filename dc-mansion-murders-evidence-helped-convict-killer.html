Savvas, Amy and Philip Savopoulos were pronounced dead at the scene. Figueroa was given CPR and transported to a local hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Daron Wint was convicted on charges of murder, kidnapping, burglary, extortion, arson and theft Thursday. He had pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/HT_wint_booking_photo_dc_sk_150522_hpEmbed_1_11x14_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Wint was on trial for seven weeks for the home invasion and brutal killings. During the trial, his defense team claimed that his brothers had committed the murders while he unknowingly remained downstairs. Wint's brother Darrell Wint testified against him and provided an alibi for the timeframe of the crime. He has not been charged in the case.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">ABC News obtained evidence photos from inside the Savopouloses' mansion, surveillance video of Wint, a 911 call made the day of the house fire and other pieces of evidence presented during Wint's trial.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Beginning on May 13, 2015, the victims were held captive overnight as the adults were bound to chairs, beaten with a baseball bat and strangled. An autopsy found that the couple's 10-year-old son, Philip, had been killed by "thermal and sharp-force injuries." He was found in his bedroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmInsideRoom2_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmproche_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Investigators said the fire in the home had been started in Philip’s bedroom. Amy Savopoulos’ Porsche was found burning in a church parking lot in neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland, the same afternoon as the bodies were discovered.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Wint was tied to the scene after investigators found DNA evidence off a half-eaten pizza found in the home. After a nationwide manhunt, police found him on May 20, 2015, stopping his car near the Maryland-D.C. border. In it, they found "a large stack of what appeared to be $100 bills" and money orders, according to court documents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmPizza_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmBat_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Savvas Savopoulos' assistant Jordan Wallace testified that his boss had left him a voicemail the night before the murders, asking him to go to Savopoulos’ office the following morning for a package.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Among the evidence obtained by ABC News is a surveillance video showing Wallace and Savopoulos’ colleague in a bank the next morning, May 14, 2015, as the colleague withdraws a large amount of money. Wallace says that per Savopoulos’ instructions, he then drove to the family’s home and left a package containing $40,000 on the seat of one of the cars parked in the family's garage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmInsideRoom3_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmInsideRoom_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Evidence photos include images of the box that held the pizza tied to Wint, a baseball bat with what appeared to be blood located in the bedroom where three of the victims were found, the remains of Amy Savopoulos’ car and the mansion after the fire had been extinguished.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Prosecutors insist Wint acted alone. Wint’s sentencing hearing has been scheduled for February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmHallway_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_dcmmBed_le_181026_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmibnGWdlru0tc6nZKatopmys7%2BMnq2inJWjsKZ5x56jqZ2UYrCwutWimq1lm565rbHRaKqtp6KujKqwnG5vcG9laIVy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wyatt-elizabeth-kelce.html><span>←</span><span>Is Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce The First Daughter of NFL Star Jason Kelce?</span></a>
