<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>President Obama Calls Out Kanye West on Jimmy Kimmel Live</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It truly is his Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy! <strong><a href=#>President Obama</a></strong> called out <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> on Jimmy Kimmel Live during his Thursday, Mar. 12 appearance, after the rapper claimed the leader of the Free World calls his house.</p><p>In a recent chat with Oxford University students, West claimed: "I understand that I’m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people, call <strong>Elon Musk </strong>out of the blue or call Obama out of the blue — Obama calls the home phone, by the way."</p><p>Kimmel — who was famously targeted by West in an epic 2013 Twitter rant ("#nodisrespecttobenaffleck #alldisrespecttojimmykimmel!!!") — asked the President for his take on his personal relationship with <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>'s husband.</p><p>"I've met Kanye twice," the President responded. "The first time when I was a senator. He was with his mom [the late Donda West]. He had just gotten big. He's from Chicago, so they wanted to meet. He was very soft-spoken, very gracious. He was a young guy. He hadn't quite… come into his own."</p><p></p><p>Obama then recalled his second encounter with West, which took place last October and was documented by Kardashian (naturally!) via Instagram. "About six months ago, he came to an event," the 44th President of the United States continued. "Look, I love his music. He's incredibly creative. I don't think I've got his home number."</p><p><a href=#>#FBF POTUS</a></p><p>A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 30, 2015 at 2:47pm PST</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>(POTUS had previously called Kanye a "jackass" on two separate occasions back in 2013, and raised his eyebrows at the superstar couple's lifestyle, which even prompted a scathing reaction from <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong>.)</p><p>Rest aside, Obama told Kimmel on Thursday that he and FLOTUS try to keep their teenage daughters Malia and Sasha from making headlines. "Michelle and I try to emphasize to them that we don’t want them on TMZ," the President joked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKernaOesaa602amm5mdlnqkrculqmanpal6rK3Nspxmr5WowW67zWahoqWdrnqstcymnKVlnJ7DpnmRaWhuaWNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cast-of-pain-hustlers-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Daughter Of Liza In Pain Hustlers: Meet Cast Chloe Coleman!</span></a>
